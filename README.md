## What is this?

The **Nodecast browser extension** bridges your web browsing to your self-hosted Nodecast server. Select text on any page, save it with a click and it becomes instantly searchable in your personal knowledge base.

No tracking. Local-first. Your data stays on your machine.

---

## Features
- **Save highlights** — Select text and save directly to Nodecast
- **Markdown storage** — Highlights are saved as standard Markdown files.
- **Keyboard shortcut** — `Alt+Shift+R` to save without leaving your flow
- **Context menu** — Right-click any selection and choose "Save highlight to Nodecast"
- **Quick stats** — Popup shows how many highlights you've saved
- **Organized** — Each save includes source URL, page title, timestamp, and domain

## Usage

3. A confirmation notification appears

**Method 2 — Context menu:**

- Quick links to search your Nodecast knowledge base

---

## Saved Format

Each saved highlight is stored on your Nodecast server as markdown:

```markdown
---
title: "Page Title"
source: https://example.com/page
author: example.com
date: 2026-05-16
baseUrl: https://example.com
timestamp: 2026-05-16T10:30:00.000Z
---

Your highlighted text goes here...
```

Compatible with Obsidian, VS Code, and any markdown editor.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Alt+Shift+R` | Save selected text to Nodecast |
| Click extension icon | Open popup with stats |

To customize shortcuts: `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`

---

## Permissions

Why the extension needs certain permissions:

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `storage` | Track highlight count locally |
| `activeTab` | Read selected text on current page |
| `contextMenus` | Add right-click menu option |
| `scripting` | Inject save logic into web pages |
| `http://localhost/*` | Connect to your local Nodecast server |

No data is sent to third parties. No browsing history is collected. Everything stays local.

---

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarox-dev/Nodecast-Extension.git
cd Nodecast-Extension
# Edit files directly
# Load unpacked in Chrome to test
```

No build step required — the extension uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

---

## Requirements

- **Chrome** (version 88+) or any Chromium-based browser (Edge, Brave, Opera)
- **Nodecast server** running at `http://localhost:5000` ([setup guide](https://github.com/sarox-dev/Nodecast))
- Firefox support is planned.
